        <p><b>H3N2 continues to diversify with many coexisting clades, all of which carry several amino acid mutations at previously characterized epitopes. The majority of viruses fall into the 3c2.a clade which has been dominating globally for >3 years, but 3c3a viruses continue to persist. The common ancestor of circulating H3N2 viruses is now more than 5 years old, which is rare for H3N2. Despite extensive genetic diversity, serological assays suggest limited antigenic evolution. We expect 3c2.a virus to continue to dominate and eventually take over.  </b></p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>We base our primary analysis on a set of viruses collected between Feb 2015 and Aug 2017, comprising approximately 100 viruses per month during relevant months of 2017.
        We use all available data when estimating frequencies of mutations and weight samples appropriately by regional population size to arrive at a global frequency estimate.</p>

        At the level of major clades, 3c2.a has continued to dominate while 3c3.a persisted at about 20% in Oceania and North America.
        Within 3c2.a, the 171K clade had risen rapidly early 2016 but later stabilized at about 50% with somewhat higher frequencies in Europe.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h3n2_clades.png 12 %}

        There are three notable surviving clades within 3c2.a but outside of the 171K clade.
        A clade with T131K/R142K continues to be common in China (but not in South Asia) with an embedded cluster of South and North American isolates from last summer.
        There is little evidence for antigenic evolution in the HI or FRA data. The 131K substitution is not seen outside this clade.

        The clade with N121K/S144K has rising steadily over the last 18 month and accumulated substantial diversity.
        The latest rapidly rising clade carries mutations T135K/R150K.
        Again, there is little evidence for antigenic evolution.

        A third clade with substitutions N31S/D53N/S144R/N171K/I192T/Q197H was observed globally over the past 9 month.
        HI suggest a moderate (4-fold) titer drop relative to A/HongKong/4801/2014.

        We observed substantial diversification within the 171K over the past year.
        Mutations at positions 193 and 198 show up sporadically, while clades with mutations at position 135 generally developed into tight rapidly growing clusters.
        The most rapidly growing one carries mutations N121K/K92R/H311Q/E62G/R142G/T135K.
        This cluster also seems to have slighly changed antigenic properties.

        <p>The most notable subclade of 3c3.a is a clade carrying the substitution F193S. However, this clade along with its sister clades has been decreasing in recent month and it doesn't show a consistent signal of antigenic change. </p>

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h3n2_mutations.png 12 %}

        <p>A more dynamic picture emerges from the 3c2.a clade, where 4 major clades have been observed at similar frequencies over the past month. Three have small tight subclades that increased in frequency recently</p>

        <p><b>A clade comprising mutations S74R and I295V has recently risen to >90% global frequency.
        Although it shows no antigenic distinction by ferret HI data, the rapidity of its rise suggests a selective origin.</b></p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p>We base our primary analysis on a set of viruses collected between Feb 2015 and Aug 2017, comprising approximately 100 viruses per month during relevant months of 2017.
        We use all available data and weight samples appropriately by regional population size to arrive at a global frequency estimate.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h1n1pdm_counts.png 12 %}

        <p>H1N1pdm recently underwent a selective sweep of the 6b.1 clade comprising mutations S162N and I216T.
        Nearly all currently circulating H1N1pdm viruses are clade 6b.1.
        Correspondingly, the H1N1pdm vaccine strain was updated in Sep 2016 to match 6b.1 viruses.

        <p>There has been little diversification within clade 6b.1 with a couple notable exceptions.
        There is a clade comprising mutations S74R and I295V that has been very successful.
        Within this clade, there is a more recent subclade with the additional mutation S164T.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h1n1pdm_tree.png 12 %}

        <p>The S74R and I295V clade has risen rapidly in frequency starting around Jan 2017.
        This clade has been very successful is now at approximately 92% global frequency.
        Within this clade the subclade comprising S164T has risen in frequency from April 2017 and is now at approximately 35% global frequency.

        <p>Other mutations have appeared within 6b.1 viruses including S183P, R205K and I324V, but none of these have been very successful and are now declining in response to the rise of S74R and I295V.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h1n1pdm_mutations.png 12 %}

        <p>Antigenic analysis using HI measurements provided by the Influenza Division at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fails to show any distinction within recently circulating H1N1pdm viruses.
        Like the clades 6b and 6b.1 clade before it, the new S74R and I295V clade does not show any titer drop despite there being ample measurements.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h1n1pdm_tree_titer_model.png 12 %}

        It was previously observed that clade 6b viruses with mutation K163Q showed decreased titers in a subset of adult human sera due to immunodominance effects, despite continued high titers in ferret sera (<a href="">Linderman et al 2014</a>).
        Importantly, the new S74R and I295V clade has spread at a similarly rapid rate as did clades 6b and 6b.1.
        This rate of spread and displacement of existing viral diversity is consistent with a selective driver.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h1n1pdm_mutations_6b_6b1.png 12 %}

        <p><i>Given current patterns of growth and decline it is almost certain that the S74R and I295V clade will dominant in a years time.
        Although there is no antigenic effect visible via HI from ferret antisera, the rapidity of the rise of S74R and I295V suggests a selective origin.
        We would suggest a detailed examination of human serological data as it's already been established that human serology may differ from ferret serology in H1N1pdm viruses.</i>

        <p><b>A clade comprising with a two amino acid deletion 162-/163- has altered serological properties and is increasing in frequency.
        Two other clades (substitions K209N and V87A/I175V have increased in frequency rapidly.</b></p>

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/vic_counts.png 12 %}

        While the substitution I175V is restricted to North America (given our current sample), K209N is largely restricted to East Asia.
        The drifted clade with the deletion, however, is represented in most geographic regions.
        While currently at low frequency, growth of this clade should be closely monitored.
