        <p><b>A clade comprising mutations S74R and I295V has recently risen to >90% global frequency.
        Although it shows no antigenic distinction by ferret HI data, the rapidity of its rise suggests a selective origin.</b>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p>We base our primary analysis on a set of viruses collected between Feb 2015 and Aug 2017, comprising approximately 100 viruses per month during relevant months of 2017.
        We use all available data and weight samples appropriately by regional population size to arrive at a global frequency estimate.

        <p>H1N1pdm recently underwent a selective sweep of the 6b.1 clade comprising mutations S162N and I216T.
        Nearly all currently circulating H1N1pdm viruses are clade 6b.1.
        Correspondingly, the H1N1pdm vaccine strain was updated in Sep 2016 to match 6b.1 viruses.

        <p>There has been little diversification within clade 6b.1 with a couple notable exceptions.
        There is a clade comprising mutations S74R and I295V that has been very successful.
        Within this clade, there is a more recent subclade with the additional mutation S164T.

        <p>The S74R and I295V clade has risen rapidly in frequency starting around Jan 2017.
        This clade has been very successful is now at approximately 92% global frequency.
        Within this clade the subclade comprising S164T has risen in frequency from April 2017 and is now at approximately 35% global frequency.

        <p>Other mutations have appeared within 6b.1 viruses including S183P, R205K and I324V, but none of these have been very successful and are now declining in response to the rise of S74R and I295V.

        <p>Antigenic analysis using HI measurements provided by the Influenza Division at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fails to show any distinction within recently circulating H1N1pdm viruses.
        Like the 6b.1 clade before it, the new S74R and I295V clade does not show any titer drop despite there being ample measurements.
        It was observed that naive ferret antisera failed to capture an antigenic drift event that occured in 6b.1 viruses.
        This was because of immune history and immunodominance effects as described in XXX.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h1n1pdm_tree_titer_model.png 12 %}

        <p><i>Given current patterns of growth and decline is almost certain that the S74R and I295V clade will dominant in a years time.
        Although there is no antigenic effect visible via HI from ferret antisera, the rapidity of the rise of S74R and I295V suggests a selective origin.
        We would suggest a detailed examination of human serological data as it's already been established that human serology may differ from ferret serology in H1N1pdm viruses.</i>
