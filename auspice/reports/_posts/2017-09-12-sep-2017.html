        <p><b>H3N2 continues to diversify with many coexisting clades, all of which carry several amino acid mutations at previously characterized epitopes. The majority of viruses fall into the 3c2.a clade which has been dominating globally for >3 years, but 3c3a viruses continue to persist. The common ancestor of circulating H3N2 viruses is now more than 5 years old, which is rare for H3N2. Despite extensive genetic diversity, serological assays suggest limited antigenic evolution. We expect 3c2.a virus to continue to dominate and eventually take over.  </b></p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>We base our primary analysis on a set of viruses collected between Feb 2015 and Aug 2017, comprising approximately 100 viruses per month during relevant months of 2017.
        We use all available data when estimating frequencies of mutations and weight samples appropriately by regional population size to arrive at a global frequency estimate.</p>

        <p>The most notable subclade of 3c3.a is a clade carrying the substitution F193S. However, this clade along with its sister clades has been decreasing in recent month and it doesn't show a consistent signal of antigenic change. </p>

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h3n2_3c3a.png 12 %}

        <p>A more dynamic picture emerges from the 3c2.a clade, where 4 major clades have been observed at similar frequencies over the past month. Three have small tight subclades that increased in frequency recently</p>

        <p><b>A clade comprising mutations S74R and I295V has recently risen to >90% global frequency.

        <p>We base our primary analysis on a set of viruses collected between Feb 2015 and Aug 2017, comprising approximately 100 viruses per month during relevant months of 2017.
        We use all available data and weight samples appropriately by regional population size to arrive at a global frequency estimate.

        <p>H1N1pdm recently underwent a selective sweep of the 6b.1 clade comprising mutations S162N and I216T.
        Nearly all currently circulating H1N1pdm viruses are clade 6b.1.
        Correspondingly, the H1N1pdm vaccine strain was updated in Sep 2016 to match 6b.1 viruses.

        <p>There has been little diversification within clade 6b.1 with a couple notable exceptions.
        There is a clade comprising mutations S74R and I295V that has been very successful.
        Within this clade, there is a more recent subclade with the additional mutation S164T.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h1n1pdm_tree.png 12 %}

        <p>The S74R and I295V clade has risen rapidly in frequency starting around Jan 2017.
        This clade has been very successful is now at approximately 92% global frequency.
        Within this clade the subclade comprising S164T has risen in frequency from April 2017 and is now at approximately 35% global frequency.

        <p>Other mutations have appeared within 6b.1 viruses including S183P, R205K and I324V, but none of these have been very successful and are now declining in response to the rise of S74R and I295V.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h1n1pdm_mutations.png 12 %}

        <p>Antigenic analysis using HI measurements provided by the Influenza Division at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fails to show any distinction within recently circulating H1N1pdm viruses.
        Like the 6b.1 clade before it, the new S74R and I295V clade does not show any titer drop despite there being ample measurements.
        It was observed that naive ferret antisera failed to capture an antigenic drift event that occured in 6b.1 viruses.
        This was because of immune history and immunodominance effects as described in XXX.

        {% embed_image /reports/figures/sep-2017/h1n1pdm_tree_titer_model.png 12 %}

        <p><i>Given current patterns of growth and decline is almost certain that the S74R and I295V clade will dominant in a years time.
        Although there is no antigenic effect visible via HI from ferret antisera, the rapidity of the rise of S74R and I295V suggests a selective origin.
        We would suggest a detailed examination of human serological data as it's already been established that human serology may differ from ferret serology in H1N1pdm viruses.</i>
